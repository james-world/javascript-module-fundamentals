# javascript-module-fundamentals
A repo based on the Pluralsight course of the same name.

Use the different branches to experiement with different stages of the course.
The branch names should be self explanatory.

Don't forget to run `npm install` to get the different packages a branch requires,
I was fairly good about adding and removing packages so that just the required
packages are in each branch.

If you have a problem with a branch after `npm start`, it's probably because you haven't
performed a build step covered in the course. Check the `git log` log messages for
instructions on the build commands that may be required,
since I did not commit any build output.
